# About Emoji Cheatsheet &#128640;

Emoji cheatsheet with more than 1000 of emojis available for easy copy and consultation. 

# Why I created this app

I thought this web app would be a very good practice to deepen my skills with React. 

# What I learned

I learned how to manage different data in a single page based on user input via search bar and category buttons. The most challeging part for me was the pagination.


# Language and Libraries
* Typescript
* React
* Chakra-UI
* Axios
* Vite

# Architecture

## Front End

On this web app I'm simply doing an API call on the frontend to the [Emoji Hub API](https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub). Then I just treating the data and display it on a grid by category.
